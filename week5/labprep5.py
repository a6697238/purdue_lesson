# This is a demonstration of basic Graphics module functions
# Full documentation of the Graphics module can be found in

#
# This program creates a 400 x 300 Graphics window an a Text
#  object prompting the user to click in the window.A circle is drawn
#  wherever a mouse click is detected with a random radius(5-20) and
#  a random color (red,blue,green or purple ) After 5 mouse clicks , the text object is changed to
# prompt the user to click one more time,then closes the window.
