# This program calculates the distance traveled by a
# tennis ball in space at a time specified by the user



# Display a message describing the functionality of the program

# Prompt the user for the initial velocity of the ball

# Prompt the user for the time in seconds

# Calculate the distance traveled using the formula:

# distance = velocity * time

# Display the results of the calculation



# Function: Calculate the distance traveled
# # v: velocity
# # t: time
# # return
# # distance = velocity * time
