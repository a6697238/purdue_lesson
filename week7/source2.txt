I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
With such an enduring pain
That it keeps them in the pouring rain
Who's to blame
For tooting 'caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
